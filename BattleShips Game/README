=============================
SpaceShipFactory.java - This class has a single static method (createSpaceships(String[])),
which is currently empty. It is used by the supplied driver to create all the spaceship objects
according to the command line arguments

SpaceShip.java - The spaceship object that is used in the SpaceWars game. It's a abstract class.
All Ships have these functions and variables, and there are two abstracts methods:
doAction who represent the specific action for each Ship and getImage who return the image of the ship

This class is an abstract class, so i have created few subclass:
- HumanShip.java : This class represents a ship controlled by a human
- RunnerShip.java : a ship that tries to avoid all other ships.
- BasherShip.java : a ship that deliberately tries to collide with other ships.
- Aggressive.java : a ship that tries to pursue other ships and fire at them
- Drunkard.java : a ship that fire randomly proximally once per 100 round, and revolves around him.
- Special.java : a ship who have the same features that the aggressive ship but with a different image

=============================
I have changed the SpaceShip class to an abstract class, then for all different types of spaceships i
build a subclass of Spaceship, we define two function:
- doAction who represent the specific action for each Ship
- getImage who return the image of the ship
Thanks to these abstracts class we are able to add or modify each ships easily by modify its class. (Extensibility)
We can also add or delete some ships by adding or deleted class (Modularity)

- Special Ship: i modify the image of the ship
